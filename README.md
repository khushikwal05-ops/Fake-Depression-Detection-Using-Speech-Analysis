# 🧠 ManoVani – Conversational AI for Depression Detection

**ManoVani** is a voice-enabled AI system that intelligently detects signs of depression by analyzing both speech and text. It simulates an empathetic dialogue with users, offering support while classifying their mental state into no depression, mild/false depression, or true depression. Built using machine learning and natural language processing, it aims to provide early mental health intervention.

## 🌟 Features

- 🗣️ **Voice Assistant (Sakhi)** – Natural conversation via voice
- 📊 **NBTree Classifier** – Hybrid Naive Bayes + Decision Tree model
- 🔍 **Feature Engineering** – PCA & standard scaling applied on extracted features
- 🧾 **Data Source** – DAIC-WOZ dataset for depression detection
- 📁 **Audio Feedback** – Generates AI voice output after analysis
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** – Local inference, no personal data stored or uploaded

📦 Installation
Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NandiniJaiswal05/Fake-Depression-Detection-Using-Speech-Analysis.git
cd Fake-Depression-Detection-Using-Speech-Analysis
```
Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
▶️ Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```
Speak when prompted.

The AI will process your voice and provide a depression assessment.

Response is saved and played from response.mp3.

## 🧪 Dataset Used
- Name: DAIC-WOZ Dataset

- Files Used: covarep.csv, formant.csv, transcript.csv, audio.wav

- Purpose: Detect depression from speech and facial cues during interviews.

##🔍 Model Details
- Algorithm: Ensemblled Learning (RandomForest, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, NBTree)

# Preprocessing:

- StandardScaler for normalization

- PCA for reducing noise and complexity

**Performance: Optimized on validation subset of DAIC-WOZ**
